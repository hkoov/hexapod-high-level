ser0 is for the LEFT half of the robot
ser1 is for RIGHT

Motor 1 is at the front, 3 is at the back

Joint 1 articulates the coxa
Joint 2 articulates the femur

Have a separate module that reads the controller events and writes them to an object

The main loop then reads that object and translates it into the desired movements and joint angles
